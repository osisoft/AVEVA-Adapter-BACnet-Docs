# Device status

The device status indicates the health of the component and whether it is currently communicating properly with the data source. This time-series data is stored within a PI point or ADH stream, depending on the endpoint type.

The BACnet adapter sends a status value of `Good` when all configured BACnet devices and routers respond within the specified timeout. When a BACnet device fails to respond to more than one **AllowedConsecutiveFailedRequests**,  it is considered disconnected and a `DeviceInError` status is sent. For more information, see [PI Adapter for BACnet data source configuration](xref:PIAdapterforBACnetDataSourceConfiguration). For any individual device that transitions from connected to disconnected and vice versa, an appropriate status is sent. If there are one or more disconnected devices, `DeviceInError` is sent; if all devices are connected, `Good` is sent.

| **Time**                          | `string`                               | Timestamp of the event        |
| **DeviceStatus**                  | `string`                               | The value of the `DeviceStatus` |

The possible statuses:

| Status                            | Meaning                               |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `Good`                          | The component is connected to the data source and it is collecting data. |
| `ConnectedNoData`               | The component is connected to the data source but it is not receiving data from it. |
| `AttemptingFailover`            | The adapter is attempting to failover. |
| `Starting`                      | The component is currently in the process of starting up and is not yet connected to the data source. |
| `DeviceInError`                 | The component encountered an error either while connecting to the data source or attempting to collect data. |
| `Shutdown`                      | The component is either in the process of shutting down or has finished. |
| `Removed`                       | The adapter component has been removed and will no longer collect data. |
| `NotConfigured`                 | The adapter component has been created but is not yet configured. |
