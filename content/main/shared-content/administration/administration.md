# Administration

With the PI adapter administration level functions, you can start and stop an adapter service and the individual adapter ingress components. You can also retrieve product version information and delete an adapter.

The examples in the administration topics use `curl`, a commonly available tool on both Windows and Linux. You can use the same operations with any programming language or tool that supports making REST calls. You can also configure PI adapters with the EdgeCmd utility. For more information, see the [EdgeCmd utility documentation](https://docs.osisoft.com/bundle/edgecmd/page/index.html). To validate successful configurations, you can accomplish data retrieval steps (`GET` commands) using a browser, if available on your device.

For more information on PI adapter configuration tools, see [Configuration tools](xref:ConfigurationTools).
